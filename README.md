- ## üìã Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to leverage sentiment analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique, to classify Amazon product reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

In today‚Äôs e-commerce environment, consumer reviews are crucial in shaping purchasing behavior. However, manually analyzing vast volumes of customer feedback is not scalable. This project applies supervised machine learning to automate sentiment detection using review text, star ratings, and product metadata.

The solution is designed to provide real-time insights into customer satisfaction, enhance product offerings, and guide marketing strategies with data-driven precision.
